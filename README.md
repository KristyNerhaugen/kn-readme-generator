# Challenge Nine: README Generator ![MIT badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
### For this challenge, I created a README Generator. The KN README Generator prompts the user to enter a name, GitHub account username, email address, project name, project description, installation instructions, usage information, credits information, information about how to contribute, and information about how to run tests on their application. Users are also prompted to select a license option. Once users answer all prompts, a high-quality README is generated with a title, description, linking table of contents, and labeled sections. The generated README can be found in the dist folder. Examples of sample generated READMEs can be found in the dist folder on this GitHub repository. There is no link to a deployed application because this application runs through the command-line

## Table of Contents 
  ### [Installation](#installation)
  ### [Usage](#usage)
  ### [Credits](#credits) 
  ### [License](#license)

## Installation
### Access the code via GitHub. Fork, clone, or download the code. This application only works using node and requires the installation of the Inquirer package, which can be found here: [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). 

## Usage
### This application is to be used to generate a quality README. 

### This video shows the functionality of the application:

## Credits 
### I used what I learned in the BootCamp Spot modules and BootCamp classes to create this scheduler. Starter code was provided to me by the BootCamp. The starter code can be found here: [Starter Code](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/potential-enigma). I used the following guide to ensure the generated READMEs were professional: [Coding BootCamp README guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide). I used these two sites to assist with markdown language: [W3schools Markdown Information](https://www.w3schools.io/file/markdown-links/) and [GitHub Markdown Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). I used this mdn web docs to better understand template literals: [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals). Also, I used these two sources to generate the license information: [Choose a license](https://choosealicense.com/) and [Markdown License Badges](https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba). I used the inquirer package for this application: [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer#questions). I used the node website to better understand Node.js: [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-nodejs-fs-module). I referred to the BootCamp spot blog for information about how to create a video tutorial: [Coding BootCamp Video Submission Guide](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-nodejs-fs-module).
